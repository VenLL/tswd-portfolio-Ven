# Visualizing Government Debt
## Summary Of The Three Charts:

### 1. OECD Bar Chart
The first visualization is an original bar chart made by OECD.
I love how the chart is easy on the eyes in terms of its simple color usage, and love how it is interactive in a way that more data can be attained once one scrolls over each individual bar. 

However, it is at times hard to link the names of the countries to its respective bar, as the country names are slanted, and the eyes can appear to be lost amongst the bars when they all have the same color.
(Note: On the website where the original OECD bar chart was located, the chart was designed in a way that bars would change color when one clicked on it—which is great. Unfortunately, this feature is lost when the chart becomes embedded to GitHub.)


### 2. Line Chart:

This line chart was made by myself via _flourish_ and the instructions of Prof. Goranson.

I like how the names of the countries are simplified to their three-digit acronyms. I also like how simple the use of color is. As there is a different line chart for every documented country, I like how one is able to focus on the trends of each individual country through this positioning. 

However, the abbreviations of the counties may make it harder for certain audiences to understand, as not everyone may be familiar with country acronyms. Additionally, it is hard to compare each country’s data and trends with other countries when they are all situated in separate charts. It is also challenging to link the year frames for the x axis to the graphs when there is only one x axis that show the year points, and it is situated so down below. 

When I tried to duplicate the x axis label so that the year points could be emphasized under each individual chart; the row of charts at the bottom of the graph would happen to get their year points “cut off”, no matter how I tried. The whole graph looked weirder with the “cut off” labels at the bottom of the graph. Thus, I decided to leave the x axis label as they originally were: that only the last row of charts would have the year frames labeled. I am still unsure of the reason behind having the last row of labels “cut off” when trying to duplicate the year frames.
This will be something I would like to solve when working with _Flourish_ in the future.


### 3. Animated Bar Chart:

I wanted to have a chart that was different to the regular, ordinary bar chart or line chart, yet not be so flashy as to take away the focus from the data.

I was happy to find the animated bar chart template on _Flourish_. It not only made the bar chart fun to look at, but did a great job at leading its audience through the data throughout the respective years. It is amazing how one is able to see the yearly ranking of ten countries with the most debt and their respective ratios in a short period of time, thanks to the animation.

I also like how one is able to include images of country flags that correspond to each of the countries. Flags make it much easier to understand which country each specific bar is addressing. It is also great to catalogue the regions of the countries according to their continents and via the usage of color-coding. It not only adds another layer to the information, but also adds a layer of visual stimulation without making it too weary for the eyes.

As the OECD dataset deals with data of various countries spanning across decades; I decided that an animated bar chart could be an efficent way to not only address the debt ratios of countries throughout the years, but also build a sense of comparison between the different counties for every documented year. I chose to create an animated "race" that would showcase the top ten counties with the most government debt-to-gdp ratios per year, and also color-coded the countries according to their continents, so that viewers may hopefully gain a general understanding of debt-to-gdp ratios across differing regions.

Although I had included data points up to the year 2022; it is interesting to see how _Flourish_ wasn't able to process and showcase the 2022 data. Or in other words, maybe _Flourish_ chose to not include the data of the year 2022. I am still unsure and thus curious about the reasoning behind this, but guess that a potential reason may be that there weren't enough countries that had sufficient data for the year 2022.
