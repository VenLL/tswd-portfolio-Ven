As this the OECD dataset deals with data of various countries spanning over decades; I decided that an animated bar chart could be an efficent way to not only address the debt ratios of countries throughout the years, but also build a sense of comparison between the different counties for each documented year. I chose to create an animated "race" that would showcase the top ten counties with the most government debt-to-gdp ratios per year, and also color coded the countries via their regions, so that viewers could also get a general understanding of debt-to-gdp ratios across the regions.
