# Overview
This is Ven's porfolio for telling stories with data at CMU. I am so glad to be a participant of this course!

This is where the cool work will go, so please stay tuned :).



# About me
Hi! I'm Ven, a CMU graduate student who adores dogs.
The more I learn about data analytics and data visualizations, the more I am fascinated by it. 

Visualization and story telling do go hand in hand when it comes to analytical projects, and one small adjustment can make all the difference. 

I am so glad to be exploring and advancing my relationship with data, and hope that this may become something I get to do for a living. 

# What I hope to learn
Everything that I possibly can - obviously. 

Here are my three main goals: 

1. Create data visualizations following good design practices 
2. Present data and stories about the data in user-friendly ways
3. Cultivate a taste for visualizations that are well-designed and aware of context
