# The final data story
My final data story was made via Shorthand([link](https://preview.shorthand.com/ilRwiKkcFKqY56GI)).


# Changes made since Part II
1. I tried to clarify the meaning behind the x and y axis of each graph.
2. I tried to clarify the story of my graph via word flow and graph flows.
3. I made sure citations and references were addressed.
4. I tried to make typography consistent and hierarchy understandable.
5. I tried making a clearer call to action: check SIR Rates via CMS.gov.
6. I tried to make the color tone of my data story consistent with the usage of blues, greens, whites, and blacks.

## The audience
I tried clarifying my intended audience to be people who will visit hospitals and are looking to select hospitals.
I thus reduced the use of data jargon and tried to use succinct language and simple graphs and images to help this intended audience understand my data story.
