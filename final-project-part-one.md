# Outline
 
## Project Summary:
Medicare—the U.S. health insurance program for people 65 and over, affects the quality of lives of millions of Americans across the U.S.

The insurance system has its strengths, yet it is also flawed.

One of its problems is the fact that healthcare quality provided by Medicare varies across differing counties and hospitals. There may be certain hospitals that may also abuse their funding and have thoughtless or careless expenditures that do not benefit the patients. This creates additional funding challenges and hurts all taxpayers.

The goal of this project is to identify potential issues in Medicare, and also detect certain trends amongst the issues. 

By addressing this topic, we may hopefully be able to discover possible improvements that can be made in the current policy and ensure the programs fit the growing healthcare needs. The data-tidying and visualizations may also hopefully become helpful to patients and patients’ families when trying to choose a hospital or location that may have lower rates of hospital infection which would lead to lower probabilities of Medicare not being able to support certain insurance coverages.

## Project Structure:

### Story Arc:
![graph](/4.jpeg)

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 



## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
