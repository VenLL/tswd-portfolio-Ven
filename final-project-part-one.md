# Outline
 
## Project Summary:
Medicare—the U.S. health insurance program for people 65 and over, affects the quality of lives of millions of Americans across the U.S.

The insurance system has its strengths, yet it is also flawed.

One of its problems is the fact that healthcare quality provided by Medicare varies across differing counties and hospitals. There may be certain hospitals that may also abuse their funding and have thoughtless or careless expenditures that do not benefit the patients. This creates additional funding challenges and hurts all taxpayers.

The goal of this project is to identify potential issues in Medicare, and also detect certain trends amongst the issues. 

Beginning in October 2014, CMS used the hospital-acquired condition (HAC) quality measures to rank the hospital's performance. The worst-performing quartile in terms of HAC would face a reduction in Medicare fee-for-service payments from the CMS (cms.gov, 2023). 

Public health HAI models (Dixon, 2011) were started by hospital-based clinicians and CDC epidemiologists in the 1960s. The model was built with the goal of identifying HAI, analyzing surveillance data to recognize potential problems, and undergoing implementation to protect hospital patients, staff, and visitors to prevent particular risks. By 1976, the Joint Commission had made it mandatory for accredited hospitals to have infection control programs similar to those recommended by the CDC. In 2008, the U.S. Congress made it mandatory that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) stop giving hospitals increased payments for the care of patients with HAIs. HAI data points HAI data points have since been strongly tied to the Medicare insurance system (healthaffairs.org, 2015).

As certain hospital evaluation scores such as HAI and HAC directly affect the amount of payment hospitals are able to receive from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (cms.gov, 2023), this project would also like to detect and address locations and regions where HAI and HAC scores tend to be higher.

I will be focusing on data that documents the years 2021-2023.

# The Data
## Data Source
The four datasets are all achieved and retrieved from Data.CMU.gov—the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. (https://data.cms.gov)

## Data Usage Explanation
I plan on undergoing some cleaning and analysis with the data in order to discover any trends or phenomenons amongst the relationship between hospital information, medicare spending per beneficiary, HAI scores, HAC scores, and geographic locations.



| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
|Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZLPEfB2agSnhmHblKXW1yg2Ou254-QdQ/view?usp=share_link|This dataset records the MSPB (Medicare Spending Per Beneficiary) score, which mainly showcases the degrees to which Medicare spends on each specific hospital when compared to the national median (or midpoint) hospital|
|Hospital General Information|https://drive.google.com/file/d/18I-ygqpZ8K3cVmZdaLYA0lUB1KmehTgJ/view?usp=share_link|This is the dataset that documents a list of all the hospitals that have been registered with Medicare. It also records general information about the hospitals, such as addresses, phone numbers, hospital types, and overall hospital ratings. |
|Healthcare Associated Infections|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IsjM4xgk_YiJX_l-8bL1prnZjeG6Pp4l/view?usp=sharing|This dataset documents the HAI (Healthcare-Associated Infection) rate that measures infections that occur while the patient is in the hospital.|
|Hospital-Acquired Condition|https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CIo2EYfXVvcRTdbOgSLmokIw-wlifZcQ/view?usp=share_link|This dataset documents HAC (Hospital-Acquired Condition) scores from the HAC reduction program. The scores rank hospitals with respect to Hospital-Acquired Condition quality measures, and the total score is calculated as the equally weighted average of hospitals' individual measure scores.|

# Method and medium
I plan on undergoing data cleaning via Tableau prep and making visualizations via Tableau desktop and Fourish. I will then use Shorthand to display my final project.
