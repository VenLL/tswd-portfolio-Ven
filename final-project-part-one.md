# Outline
 
## Project Summary:
Medicareâ€”the U.S. health insurance program for people 65 and over, affects the quality of lives of millions of Americans across the U.S.

The insurance system has its strengths, yet it is also flawed.

One of its problems is the fact that healthcare quality provided by Medicare varies across differing counties and hospitals. There may be certain hospitals that may also abuse their funding and have thoughtless or careless expenditures that do not benefit the patients. This creates additional funding challenges and hurts all taxpayers.

The goal of this project is to identify potential issues in Medicare, and also detect certain trends amongst the issues. 

Beginning in October 2014, CMS used the hospital-acquired condition (HAC) quality measures to rank the hospital's performance. The worst-performing quartile in terms of HAC would face a reduction in Medicare fee-for-service payments from the CMS (cms.gov, 2023). 

Public health HAI models (Dixon, 2011) were started by hospital-based clinicians and CDC epidemiologists in the 1960s. The model was built with the goal of identifying HAI, analyzing surveillance data to recognize potential problems, and undergoing implementation to protect hospital patients, staff, and visitors to prevent particular risks. By 1976, the Joint Commission had made it mandatory for accredited hospitals to have infection control programs similar to those recommended by the CDC. In 2008, the U.S. Congress made it mandatory that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) stop giving hospitals increased payments for the care of patients with HAIs. HAI data points HAI data points have since been strongly tied to the Medicare insurance system (healthaffairs.org, 2015).

As certain hospital evaluation scores such as HAI and HAC directly affect the amount of payment hospitals are able to receive from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (cms.gov, 2023), this project would also like to detect and address locations and regions where HAI and HAC scores tend to be higher.

We will be focusing on data that documents the years 2021-2023.

## Project Structure:

### Story Arc:
![graph](/4.jpeg)

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 



## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

Text here...

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
