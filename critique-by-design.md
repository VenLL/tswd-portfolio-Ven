# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
## Step One: Finding Data Viz
I chose this visualization as it indeed speaks something important to me, yet there is still room for improvement. 

As a person who will be reentering the job market in a few years and as one who has been fascinated (and alarmed) at how fast and sudden job markets fluctuate; the dataset available on Kaggle and the data viz made by Yu-Ning Yang really drew me in. 

Additionally, there haven‚Äôt been much re-visualizations for this dataset that have already created‚Äîor at least they were not too prevalent on the internet.

Another reason for my choice of this data viz is due to the fact that I wanted to challenge myself in readjusting a data viz that was already quite good according to the critique metrics. What can be done to make the data viz and the story of the viz to be clearer, more visually-pleasing, and even more instinctive than it already is? What can be done to prevent misunderstandings and confusion for the viewersüßê? 

I will be mainly critiquing and adjusting the data viz that had appeared on the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù sheet on the original data viz.

## Step Two: Critique Data Viz
### The Seven Metrics:
**_Usefulness_** was rated a 7 as the viz communicates information that may be to people in the tech industry or people looking to opt in or opt out of the tech industry. It may also be useful for investors and financiers as it delivers information on trends in the industry. However, the lack of clarity amongst the date and the tree map undermined the viz‚Äôs potential usefulness. 



## Step Three: Drafted Solution
The drafted solutions/graphs were created with the help of infogram.
