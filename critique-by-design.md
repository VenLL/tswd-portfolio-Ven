# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
## Step One: Finding Data Viz
I chose this visualization as it indeed speaks something important to me, yet there is still room for improvement. 

As a person who will be reentering the job market in a few years and as one who has been fascinated (and alarmed) at how fast and sudden job markets fluctuate; the dataset available on Kaggle and the data viz made by Yu-Ning Yang really drew me in. 

Additionally, there haven‚Äôt been much re-visualizations for this dataset that have already created‚Äîor at least they were not too prevalent on the internet.

Another reason for my choice of this data viz is due to the fact that I wanted to challenge myself in readjusting a data viz that was already quite good according to the critique metrics. What can be done to make the data viz and the story of the viz to be clearer, more visually-pleasing, and even more instinctive than it already is? What can be done to prevent misunderstandings and confusion for the viewersüßê? 

I will be mainly critiquing and adjusting the data viz that had appeared on the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù sheet on the original data viz.

## Step Two: Critique Data Viz
### The Seven Metrics:
**_Usefulness_** was rated a 7 as the viz communicates information that may be to people in the tech industry or people looking to opt in or opt out of the tech industry. It may also be useful for investors and financiers as it delivers information on trends in the industry. However, the lack of clarity amongst the date and the tree map undermined the viz‚Äôs potential usefulness. 

**_Completeness_** was rated a 7 as the data viz is provides quite complete data that was derived from the Kaggle dataset. with its two sheets: ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaps‚Äù. However, no subtext was provided to explain the various data implied on the tree map. For instance, It may be difficult for certain readers to understand what ‚ÄúQ2‚Äù, ‚Äú5000‚Äù, and ‚Äú50‚Äù respectively depict when the data is all piled up against one another with no further units or explanations given.

**_Perceptibility_** was rated a 6 as the tree map choice with both the data of total layoff numbers and layoff percentages crammed altogether made it difficult to absorb and specify the information. It also took away a chance to logically compare total sums of numbers versus percentages, which is what I found quite interesting about the original data, and thus a pity to miss was showcasing the data onto the data viz.

**_Truthfulness_** was rated a 7. I originally gave it an even lower rating as I could not understand how percentages could be summed, as percentages relied on the base number of each respective year‚Äîwhich was bound to change throughout the years. However, once I looked further into the dataset on Kaggle; I found that the original data had in fact recorded or concluded the data in a way that the percentages of each company was only documented once, thus there would be no mistake is summing up the percentage for each respective company. The header concluding timing for the data‚Äîwhich can be easily misinterpreted on the data viz, may have also resulted from the original dataset on Kaggle. The title on Kaggle is: Technology Company Layoffs (2022-2023) when only January is recorded for the year 2023. Nevertheless, this is something that could have been identified and adjusted when making the data viz, thus the truthfulness metric was rated a 7.

**_Intuitiveness_** was rated a 6. Similar to my reasoning for the Completeness and Perceptibility metric; It can be difficult for readers to understand the information with minimal effort when much information is crammed and piled up in a single graph without extra instructions or guidelines. 

**_Aesthetics_** was rated a 8. I found the color choice, typography, and chart types to be overall quite aesthetically pleasing and easy on the eyes. However, the ‚Äúcramminess of the tree map and the lack of text and graph hierarchy‚Äîwhich would ultimately lead to viewer-restlessness, was what deducted points regarding this metric.




## Step Three: Drafted Solution
The drafted solutions/graphs were created with the help of infogram.
