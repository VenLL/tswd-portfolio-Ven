# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
## Step One: Finding Data Viz
### Reasoning behind Data Choice 
I chose this visualization as the original viz did indeed speak of something important to me, and yet there was still room for improvement. 

As a person who will be re-entering the job market in a few years and as one who has been fascinated (and alarmed) at how fast and sudden job markets fluctuate; the dataset available on Kaggle and the data viz made by Yu-Ning Yang really drew me in. 

Additionally, there hasn't been much re-designs done for this data viz‚Äîor at least they were not too prevalent on the internet.

Another reason for my choice of this data viz is due to the fact that I wanted to challenge myself in readjusting a data viz that was already quite good according to the critique metrics. What can be done to make the data viz and the story of the viz to be clearer, more visually-pleasing, and even more instinctive than it already is? What can be done to prevent misunderstandings and confusion for the viewersüßê? 

I will be mainly critiquing and adjusting the data viz that had appeared on the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù sheet on the original data viz.

## Step Two: Critique Data Viz
### The Seven Metrics:
1. **_Usefulness_** was rated a 7 as the viz communicates information that may be to people in the tech industry or people looking to opt in or opt out of the tech industry. It may also be useful for investors and financiers as it delivers information on trends in the industry. However, the lack of clarity amongst the date and the tree map undermined the viz‚Äôs potential usefulness. 

2. **_Completeness_** was rated a 7 as the data viz is provides quite complete data that was derived from the Kaggle dataset. with its two sheets: ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaps‚Äù. However, no subtext was provided to explain the various data implied on the tree map. For instance, It may be difficult for certain readers to understand what ‚ÄúQ2‚Äù, ‚Äú5000‚Äù, and ‚Äú50‚Äù respectively depict when the data is all piled up against one another with no further units or explanations given.

3. **_Perceptibility_** was rated a 6 as the tree map choice with both the data of total layoff numbers and layoff percentages crammed altogether made it difficult to absorb and specify the information. It also took away a chance to logically compare total sums of numbers versus percentages, which is what I found quite interesting about the original data, and thus a pity to miss was showcasing the data onto the data viz.

4. **_Truthfulness_** was rated a 7. I originally gave it an even lower rating as I could not understand how percentages could be summed, as percentages relied on the base number of each respective year‚Äîwhich was bound to change throughout the years. However, once I looked further into the dataset on Kaggle; I found that the original data had in fact recorded or concluded the data in a way that the percentages of each company was only documented once, thus there would be no mistake is summing up the percentage for each respective company. The header concluding timing for the data‚Äîwhich can be easily misinterpreted on the data viz, may have also resulted from the original dataset on Kaggle. The title on Kaggle is: Technology Company Layoffs (2022-2023) when only January is recorded for the year 2023. Nevertheless, this is something that could have been identified and adjusted when making the data viz, thus the truthfulness metric was rated a 7.

5. **_Intuitiveness_** was rated a 6. Similar to my reasoning for the Completeness and Perceptibility metric; It can be difficult for readers to understand the information with minimal effort when much information is crammed and piled up in a single graph without extra instructions or guidelines. 

6. **_Aesthetics_** was rated a 7. I found the color choice, typography, and chart types to be overall quite aesthetically pleasing and easy on the eyes. However, the ‚Äúcramminess of the tree map and the lack of text and graph hierarchy‚Äîwhich would ultimately lead to viewer-restlessness, was what deducted points regarding this metric.

7. **_Engagement_** was rated a 7. In order to get a more rounded understanding of the data, viewers would have to interact with the graphs. However, the engagement is out of necessity and not voluntarily. The way the viz was designed may also its viewers refrain from further sharing or engaging with the data viz with a fear of the viz being too difficult or effort-consuming for oneself or others to interpret.

### What Works?
* The overall color scheme‚Äîthe blues and yellows are easy on the eyes.
The ‚ÄúNew York Times‚Äù newspaper style stood out to me. 
* The interactiveness and data inclusion regarding the ‚Äúmap‚Äù sheet of the Tableau viz‚Äîthus the map sections will not be my area of focus when making redesigns.

###  What May Need Work?
* The header that depicts the timeline for the data‚Äî2022-2023 can be misleading when only data for January was recorded for 2023.
* The tree map filled with different data and metrics‚Äîit is not only difficult to understand but can also cause misinterpretations, as the size of the blocks counterintuitive for perception when it comes to percentages.
* Text hierarchy.
* The inclusion of instructions or subtexts when showcasing more complex charts.

### What May I Try Try To Adjust & What I Gleaned From The Critique Method?

* Break the emphasis of total layoff numbers verses the percentages into two different graphs‚Äîas the respective data tell different stories, and as it may cause misunderstanding when graphed altogether via a tree map. It may also be interesting to compare the differences as two separate graphs. 
* Clarify the timeline of the recorded data‚Äîthe data is from Jan 2022 through Jan 2023 (instead of the possibly presumed Jan 2022-Dec 2023).
* Declutter the tree map by perhaps choosing another type of graph depiction, and by focuses on the the top 10 rows or variables instead of squeezing 400 variables into one graph.
* Clarify and simplify the story for each graph.



## Step Three: Drafted Solution
The drafted solutions/graphs were created with the help of infogram.

Note: The data is fabricated and not filled according to the original Kaggle dataset at this stage of work.


### Graph 1:
This is my wireframe for the first graph of my redesigned viz. 

I attempted to make a chart that was the combination of a bar chart and a line graph, and wanted to use it to depict the trends of layoffs over the given time period that the dataset had documented (Jan 2022-Jan 2023).

### Graph 2:
This is my wireframe for the second graph of my redesigned viz.


I attempted to make a bar chart that would portray the top 10 companies that had undergone the most layoffs in regards to the total sum of layoff numbers over the given period (Jan 2022-Jan 2023).

![graph 2](/2.jpeg)


### Graph 3:
This is my wireframe for the third graph of my redesigned viz.

I attempted to make a bubble chart that would portray the companies that had the most layoffs in regards to their total layoff percentage over the given period (Jan 2022-Jan 2023).

## Step Four: Solution Testing
### Feedback received from participants:

Asides from my redesigned drafts, I had shown the participants the original data viz for comparison. This lead to great feedback that am thankful for.

### Student, early 20s:
* ‚ÄúCombining a bar chart with a line chart in one single graph may actually make the graph seem more confusing and more complicated than it would need to be.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúMaybe something more can be added to the second drafted graph? It is quite plain at the moment. Not to say that it being plain is bad, as it is clear. But maybe more information or color can be added to make it more dynamic or engaging. ‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve created two bar charts amongst your three redesigns. Ever thought of replacing a bar chart with another kind of chart?  ‚Äù

### Adult, late 50s:
* ‚ÄúIt can be a pity to remove the things that you had liked about the original graph in your new designs. For instance, the New York Times style that had been presented in the original graph was lost in the redesign.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúEven though your bubble chart looks much less crowded than the tree map in the original visualization; there is still a chance of your graph becoming unnecessary crowded through a bubble chart.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúRemember to place clear headers over your charts, as the descriptions were one thing you wanted to clarify through your new designs, yet that has been left out in your wireframes. ‚Äù


### Reflections

Thanks to the feedbacks of the participants, I decided to:

1. Make the first graph a line chart instead of a combined chart that may lead to confusion when addressing the same trend. A line chart may also be more suitable in this case, as the graph is showcasing a continuous trend over time.
2. Add point marks to the data points in the first graph in order to highlight the variation in layoff numbers and stay true to the fact that the original graph had highlighted the number jump from Dec 2022 to Jan 2023.
3. Stay true to the ‚ÄúNew York Times‚Äù style the original visualization had addressed, as the style also addresses the audience to which the charts are intended for.
4. Make clear headers and subheads for the graphs, and be aware of text hierarchy.
5. Add logos or icons instead of pure text when addressing the companies. This would hopefully not only make the charts more dynamic, but also clarify the companies, and save the viewers time in processing text.
6. As for the third graph, if bubble charts appear to be crowded, then choose another type of chart.


## Step Five: Solution Building & The Final Graphs
The drafted solutions/graphs were created via Tableau.

## Graph 1

I created a line chart as to showcase the trends throughout the given period. I made sure to use typography that resonated with the newspaper-style the original graph had given off, and tried many kinds of text hierarchy formats and sizes before settling with the final choice. I also made marks for Dec 2022 and Jan 2023, as it was an interesting point that the original viz had pointed out, and fiddled out with the designs for the points until I settled with the final style. I additionally marked out the data point for the first recorded month (Jan 2022) with a goal to emphasize the number differences from the start till the end of the recorded period.

![graph 1](/T2.jpeg)


## Graph 2

I created a bar bar chart of descending order as to showcase the top 10 companies with most layoffs in regards to total layoff numbers. As for the names of the companies, I swapped text with icons/logos, with a goal to make the bar chart more dynamic and engaging, and clarifying. The logos of these ten companies are icons that viewers may be quite familiar with, thus, the sense of familiarity may hopefully bring out the curiosity and interest for further engagement amongst the viewers.

![graph 1](/T1.jpeg)


## Graph 3

After looking deeper into the data, I realized that there were many companies that had laid off 100% of their staff. This then became my main focus of point for the third graph: to showcase companies that had undergone 100% layoffs. First, I tried making a bubble chart and found that due to the similarity amongst percentages, there was no value and reasoning in creating a bubble chart, or any chart that was intended to depict differences amongst companies.In that case, a simple text table would in fact become the most efficient way to deliver my story. However, a simple text table appeared to be boring, ugly, and not engaging at all. I then tried swapping the text for the logos of the companies, and found that it brought energy, engagement, and clarity to the graph.
