# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design
## Step One: Finding Data Viz
I chose this visualization as it indeed speaks something important to me, yet there is still room for improvement. 

As a person who will be reentering the job market in a few years and as one who has been fascinated (and alarmed) at how fast and sudden job markets fluctuate; the dataset available on Kaggle and the data viz made by Yu-Ning Yang really drew me in. 

Additionally, there haven‚Äôt been much re-visualizations for this dataset that have already created‚Äîor at least they were not too prevalent on the internet.

Another reason for my choice of this data viz is due to the fact that I wanted to challenge myself in readjusting a data viz that was already quite good according to the critique metrics. What can be done to make the data viz and the story of the viz to be clearer, more visually-pleasing, and even more instinctive than it already is? What can be done to prevent misunderstandings and confusion for the viewersüßê? 

I will be mainly critiquing and adjusting the data viz that had appeared on the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù sheet on the original data viz.

## Step Two: Critique Data Viz
### The Seven Metrics:
1. **_Usefulness_** was rated a 7 as the viz communicates information that may be to people in the tech industry or people looking to opt in or opt out of the tech industry. It may also be useful for investors and financiers as it delivers information on trends in the industry. However, the lack of clarity amongst the date and the tree map undermined the viz‚Äôs potential usefulness. 

2. **_Completeness_** was rated a 7 as the data viz is provides quite complete data that was derived from the Kaggle dataset. with its two sheets: ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù and ‚ÄúMaps‚Äù. However, no subtext was provided to explain the various data implied on the tree map. For instance, It may be difficult for certain readers to understand what ‚ÄúQ2‚Äù, ‚Äú5000‚Äù, and ‚Äú50‚Äù respectively depict when the data is all piled up against one another with no further units or explanations given.

3. **_Perceptibility_** was rated a 6 as the tree map choice with both the data of total layoff numbers and layoff percentages crammed altogether made it difficult to absorb and specify the information. It also took away a chance to logically compare total sums of numbers versus percentages, which is what I found quite interesting about the original data, and thus a pity to miss was showcasing the data onto the data viz.

4. **_Truthfulness_** was rated a 7. I originally gave it an even lower rating as I could not understand how percentages could be summed, as percentages relied on the base number of each respective year‚Äîwhich was bound to change throughout the years. However, once I looked further into the dataset on Kaggle; I found that the original data had in fact recorded or concluded the data in a way that the percentages of each company was only documented once, thus there would be no mistake is summing up the percentage for each respective company. The header concluding timing for the data‚Äîwhich can be easily misinterpreted on the data viz, may have also resulted from the original dataset on Kaggle. The title on Kaggle is: Technology Company Layoffs (2022-2023) when only January is recorded for the year 2023. Nevertheless, this is something that could have been identified and adjusted when making the data viz, thus the truthfulness metric was rated a 7.

5. **_Intuitiveness_** was rated a 6. Similar to my reasoning for the Completeness and Perceptibility metric; It can be difficult for readers to understand the information with minimal effort when much information is crammed and piled up in a single graph without extra instructions or guidelines. 

6. **_Aesthetics_** was rated a 7. I found the color choice, typography, and chart types to be overall quite aesthetically pleasing and easy on the eyes. However, the ‚Äúcramminess of the tree map and the lack of text and graph hierarchy‚Äîwhich would ultimately lead to viewer-restlessness, was what deducted points regarding this metric.

7. **_Engagement_** was rated a 7. In order to get a more rounded understanding of the data, viewers would have to interact with the graphs. However, the engagement is out of necessity and not voluntarily. The way the viz was designed may also its viewers refrain from further sharing or engaging with the data viz with a fear of the viz being too difficult or effort-consuming for oneself or others to interpret.

### What Works?
* The overall color scheme‚Äîthe blues and yellows are easy on the eyes.
The ‚ÄúNew York Times‚Äù newspaper style stood out to me. 
* The interactiveness and data inclusion regarding the ‚Äúmap‚Äù sheet of the Tableau viz‚Äîthus the map sections will not be my area of focus when making redesigns.

###  What May Need Work?
* The header that depicts the timeline for the data‚Äî2022-2023 can be misleading when only data for January was recorded for 2023.
* The tree map filled with different data and metrics‚Äîit is not only difficult to understand but can also cause misinterpretations, as the size of the blocks counterintuitive for perception when it comes to percentages.
* Text hierarchy.
* The inclusion of instructions or subtexts when showcasing more complex charts.

### What May I Try Try to Adjust?

* Break the emphasis of total layoff numbers verses the percentages into two different graphs‚Äîas the respective data tell different stories, and as it may cause misunderstanding when graphed altogether via a tree map. It may also be interesting to compare the differences as two separate graphs. 
* Clarify the timeline of the recorded data‚Äîthe data is from Jan 2022 through Jan 2023 (instead of the possibly presumed Jan 2022-Dec 2023).
* Declutter the tree map by perhaps choosing another type of graph depiction, and by focuses on the the top 10 rows or variables instead of squeezing 400 variables into one graph.
* Clarify and simplify the story for each graph.



## Step Three: Drafted Solution
The drafted solutions/graphs were created with the help of infogram.

Note: The data is fabricated and not filled according to the original Kaggle dataset upon this stage of solution drafting.

## Step Four: Solution Testing


## Step Five: Solution Building & The Final Graphs
The drafted solutions/graphs were created via Tableau.
