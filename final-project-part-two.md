# Wireframes / storyboards

I have drafted my wireframe and storyboard via shorthand ([link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/sir-rates/index.html)).

I laid out my wireframes and storylines in the order of:

1. Title + title image

2. Intro

3. Hook questions

4. SIR rates information

5. SIR and HAC rate relationship information + image

6. Interactive Tableau chart 1

7. Interactive Tableau chart 2

8. Hook question for call for action + image

9. Interactive Tableau chart 3

10. Call for action.


# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience is people who are looking to enroll and commit themselves or their loved ones to certain hospitals in order to gain treatments, checkups, or any other sort of healthcare-related assistance.

## Interview Approach
I selected 3 individuals who are of varying ages and stages in life, yet prioritize health in their lives and are highly interested in and sensitive to healthcare-related issues.
