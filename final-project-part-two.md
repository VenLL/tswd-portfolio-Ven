# Final Project Part II



# Wireframes / storyboards

I have drafted my wireframe and storyboard via shorthand ([link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/sir-rates/index.html)).

I laid out my wireframes and storylines in the order of:

1. Title + title image

2. Intro

3. Hook questions

4. SIR rates information

5. SIR and HAC rate relationship information + image

6. Interactive Tableau chart 1

7. Interactive Tableau chart 2

8. Hook question for call for action + image

9. Interactive Tableau chart 3

10. Call for action.


Note:
Unfortunately, I encountered many difficulties when trying to upload my Tableau interactive charts to shorthand. Thus, at this stage, screenshot images of my interactive charts were uploaded to shorthand instead of the published interactive charts themselves. I will make sure that my interactive charts are uploadable and viewable in shorthand before the final project’s final phase and presentation.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience is people who are looking to enroll and commit themselves or their loved ones to certain hospitals in order to gain treatments, checkups, or any other sort of healthcare-related assistance.

## Interview Approach
I selected 3 individuals who are of varying ages and stages in life, yet prioritize health in their lives, and are highly interested in and sensitive to healthcare-related issues.

Interviewee 1:

A man in his 50s who works in the healthcare industry.

Interviewee 2:

A woman in her 60s who is a retired professional with declining health.

Interviewee 3:

A female student in her 20s who has a chronic illness resulting in a need to visit hospitals every now and then.


I showed the interviewees the current materials I had uploaded to shorthand, and also the interactive charts that I had created in Tableau (as I had trouble uploading them to shorthand).


## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| 1. Gain insights that may help make the text of my wireframe and storyline smoother and easier to understand. | 1. Is the storyline understandable? Is there anything text-related that I could add, edit, or remove to make my storyline clearer to you? |
| 2. Gain insights that may help make the images of my wireframe and storyline smoother and easier to understand. | 2. Are the current images that aren’t data-driven charts or graphs helpful for the story? Are there images you think I could add, edit, or remove to make my storyline clearer to you? |
|  3. Gain insights that may help make my data-driven visualizations clearer and more engaging to the audience.     | 3. Are the data-driven visualizations clear and helpful to you? Is there anything I could do to make the data-driven visualizations direct the information in a clearer and more engaging way?                 |
|4. Gain tips and insights on how to make the arrangements on shorthand in a more visually pleasing and readable way.      |  4. Is there anything you like about the current layout (e.g.: text size, color, image-text relationship… etc..)? Is there anything you dislike about the current layout, and why? Are there any suggestions you could give regarding the current layout?                 |


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1. Is the storyline understandable? Is there anything text-related that I could add, edit, or remove to make my storyline clearer to you? |The storyline is understandable, but you could definitely make it clearer by providing more text explanation regarding SIR as the full names for the SIR may not be really explanatory or understandable themselves. | The story isn’t really clear. You could make it clearer by 1. making the space between paragraphs and lines more consistent 2. Create clearer headings for each paragraph or image/graph. 3. Create some guideline-like wording to help your audience understand the charts and how to interact with the charts. |The story is clear enough to me, but you could make it better by having titles and headings that have more engaging wordings and designs. As the data-driven visualizations are part of your story, it may be better to weave them into the story by providing more paragraphs and headers to direct the audience to understand the charts and the charts’ relevance in the current stage of your story.  |
| 2. Are the current images that aren’t data-driven charts or graphs helpful for the story? Are there images you think I could add, edit, or remove to make my storyline clearer to you?  | You could definitely add more images that help address the story. There aren’t that many images right now. For instance, you could add images that could help the audience understand each specific SIR rate. | The overlap of images and text makes both of them hard to read and understand sometimes. You could also add more images, as there aren’t many images at the moment. I like the image for the title though, as it is very stimulating.  | I would try to input images and graphs that could try to strengthen and energize the story, There is quite a lot of space you have around the text, so you could try playing around with images in that spare space. You are talking about hospital-related infections, so you could probably add images and graphs that portray hospitals. Right now, only the title image is associated with the concept of hospitals to me. I like the title image. |
| 3. Are the data-driven visualizations clear and helpful to you? Is there anything I could do to make the data-driven visualizations direct the information in a clearer and more engaging way?  |1. It’s unfortunate that you couldn't upload your interactive Tableau maps to shorthand, as the interactive maps are more fun to play with and more engaging to the audience. The audience could try to look into the regions where they live and the hospitals they plan on visiting. Try your best to upload the interactive charts 2. Give an explanation on why you chose to filter the data with age, as that reasoning is unclear right now 3. Give some reasoning and information regarding the time periods to which the data was documented, and where the data was from. Be aware of academic integrity. | 1. Some graphs are cropped weirdly and should be adjusted. 2. I like the last interactive map. Perhaps you could combine your first chart and second chart to create a chart like the last one, as the last one was the most information-abundant and interactive. 3. Remember to cite where the data came from, even if you were the one who created the charts. | I like the color tones of your interactive data charts, but the title/headings and sidebars are quite unclear. You could maybe combine chart 1 with chart 2, and make another line chart that documents trends? Or perhaps create another data-driven visualization to support your call for action. |
| 4. Is there anything you like about the current layout (e.g.: text size, color, image-text relationship… etc..)? Is there anything you dislike about the current layout, and why? Are there any suggestions you could give regarding the current layout?  | Your AVG SIR State Bar Chart is big and dominating but in a way that does not help tell the story. Maybe you could make that chart smaller, with supporting guiding text by its side. The last graph of rolling balls is interesting but irrelevant to your story. | The proportion and relationship between charts, title text, and body text can be reconsidered and redesigned. Again, more images could be added to help guide your story. | I think that there could be a lot more layout options you could try with shorthand. The layout is currently quite bland. But I do like how you’ve tried to be consistent and not overwhelming in terms of color choice. If possible, perhaps you could try to keep the typography consistent too. |


# Identified changes for Part III

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Add more images that are relevant to the story| I will find and add images that address my story, especially images that can help address information that is more abstract or difficult to understand. |
| 2. Beware of proportions and overlap |   As the overlap of image and text can create unreadability, I will be careful as to create readable hierarchies when dealing with the combination of text and images.  |
| 3. Be consistent when you should  |  Although it is good to be creative and create diversity in certain aspects of design; consistency can be key when it comes to typography, paragraph framing, and colors. I will make sure to keep such aspects consistent and more readable. |
| 4. Remember to cite    |  I will make sure not to leave out any citations in my final material, and document the citations consistently. |
|5. Add more headings, titles, and paragraphs to clarify and improve the flow of direction for my story  | I will add more headings, titles, and paragraphs to clarify and improve the flow of direction for my story, especially when it comes to data-driven visualizations, as it is hard to understand their position in the story without clearer directions.|

# Final Thoughts
I  am really glad that I created my wireframes and storyline drafts in shorthand for the interviewees to analyze. As imperfect as my draft was; the feedback I received was really helpful and would give me a better sense of direction to where I should be heading towards and aiming for when it comes to the final content and layout.
