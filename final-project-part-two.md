# Wireframes / storyboards

I have drafted my wireframe and storyboard via shorthand ([link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/sir-rates/index.html)).

I laid out my wireframes and storylines in the order of:

1. Title + title image

2. Intro

3. Hook questions

4. SIR rates information

5. SIR and HAC rate relationship information + image

6. Interactive Tableau chart 1

7. Interactive Tableau chart 2

8. Hook question for call for action + image

9. Interactive Tableau chart 3

10. Call for action.


Note:
Unfortunately, I encountered many difficulties when trying to upload my Tableau interactive charts to shorthand. Thus, at this stage, images of my interactive charts were uploaded to shorthand instead of the published interactive charts themselves. I will make sure that my interactive charts are uploadable and viewable in shorthand before the final project’s final phase and presentation.

# User research 

## Target audience
My target audience is people who are looking to enroll and commit themselves or their loved ones to certain hospitals in order to gain treatments, checkups, or any other sort of healthcare-related assistance.

## Interview Approach
I selected 3 individuals who are of varying ages and stages in life, yet prioritize health in their lives, and are highly interested in and sensitive to healthcare-related issues.

Interviewee 1:

A man in his 50s who works in the healthcare industry.

Interviewee 2:

A woman in her 60s who is a retired professional with declining health.

Interviewee 3:

A female student in her 20s who has a chronic illness resulting in a need to visit hospitals every now and then.

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| 1. Gain insights that may help make the text of my wireframe and storyline smoother and easier to understand. | 1. Is the storyline understandable? Is there anything text-related that I could add, edit, or remove to make my storyline clearer to you? |
| 2. Gain insights that may help make the images of my wireframe and storyline smoother and easier to understand. | 2. Are the current images that aren’t data-driven charts or graphs helpful for the story? Are there images you think I could add, edit, or remove to make my storyline clearer to you? |
|  3. Gain insights that may help make my data-driven visualizations clearer and more engaging to the audience.     | 3. Are the data-driven visualizations clear and helpful to you? Is there anything I could do to make the data-driven visualizations direct the information in a clearer and more engaging way?                 |
|4. Gain tips and insights on how to make the arrangements on shorthand in a more visually pleasing and readable way.      |  4. Is there anything you like about the current layout (e.g.: text size, color, image-text relationship… etc..)? Is there anything you dislike about the current layout, and why? Are there any suggestions you could give regarding the current layout?                 |
